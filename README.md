# Haxe Python Requests

Haxe externs for using the Requests library in Python.

The `haxe.Http` class included in Haxe does not cleanly support https on Python, but Requests does and is ubiquitous.

Only partial extern coverage so far. To be updated as needs of other projects require.

Pull requests welcome.
